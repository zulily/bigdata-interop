### Building

The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) connector is built with Maven 3 (as of 2014-05-23, version 3.2.1 has been tested). To build the connector for Hadoop 1, run the following commands from the main directory:

    mvn -P hadoop1 package

To build the connector with support for Hadoop 2 & YARN, run the following commands from the main directory:

    mvn -P hadoop2 package

In both cases the GCS connector JAR can be found in gcs/target/.
