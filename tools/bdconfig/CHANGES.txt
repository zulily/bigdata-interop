0.28.1 - 2014-05-08

  1. Added Python 2.6 compatibility.


0.28.0 - 2014-03-21

  1. Renamed ghconfig to bdconfig.
  2. Allowed for direct editing and querying of configuration *site.xml files.
     Run 'bdconfig help' to see the new commands.
  3. Allowed for in line replacement of '<envVar name="FOO" />' tags with the
     enviroment variable '$FOO'.
  4. Deprecated configure_hadoop, configure_ghfs, and set_default_fs commands.
  5. Switched to new 'fs.gs.auth.*' syntax for the various auth-related keys
     like client_id, client_secret, and enabling service-account auth.


0.27.2 - 2014-02-12

  1. Misc updates in client library dependencies.


0.27.1 - 2014-01-23

  1. Switched from /hadoop/temp to /hadoop/tmp and /temp to /tmp for various
     Hadoop temp directories.
  2. Got rid of the xml-local config values fs.gs.tmp.dir and
     fs.gs.tmp.dir.local; older versions of Pig don't support the necessary
     cross-config references.
  3. Removed mapred directory overrides to revert them to defaults based on
     hadoop.tmp.dir. This effectively moves mapred system files from /tmp to
     /hadoop/tmp.


0.27.0 - 2014-01-14

  1. Preview release of ghconfig.
